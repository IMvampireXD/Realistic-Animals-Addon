# Realistic-Animals-Addon
A project about adding birds and incubation related things. Adds ducks, makes chickens and some mobs more realistic. Chickens lay 3d eggs on ground, Hatch eggs in nests, and more.

## This addon is still in work, If someone wants to help, or have any issues with the addon, please contact me on discord @finnafinest_

# To-do list. we'll make:
- A chicken coop house. (Probably using structures and using custom blocks).
- Ducks (Male and Female variants) and ducklings (Baby ducks).
- Chicken Feed - Spreading into ground, The chickens will peck and eat the grains one by one.
- Egg hatching system. (Nests)
- You can pick up chickens! (and then put them in nests myb)
- Chickens lay 3d eggs on ground.
- Realistic pigs, They covered in mud ;-;
- Realistic cows, They got wheat chewing/eating animations.
- Realistic chickens, They run when players try to catch them :>
